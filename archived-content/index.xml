      <description>clouds restore in rain&#xA;the exhalations of the land and sea -H. W. Longfellow&#xA;I am a climate scientist. I try to understand what Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate would look like now, if not for human activities like greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions. Part of that involves understanding modern climate dynamics. Another part involves studying climate variability in the time before the Industrial Revolution. Figuring out the difference between those two things helps us to understand how and why Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate is changing today, and hence how it might change in the future.</description>
