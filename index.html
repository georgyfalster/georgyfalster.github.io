                                    <p><em>clouds restore in rain<br>the exhalations of the land and sea</em>
<br>            -H. W. Longfellow</p>
<p>This lovely snippet from Longfellow&rsquo;s prelude to <i>Michael Angelo</i> describes <strong>the water cycle</strong>: the movement of water around the Earth.</p>
<p>I am a climate scientist, tackling the same topic but using science. With my research I work to understand the huge range of factors influencing when, where, and why rain falls in different places around the world - and how that is changing because of climate change.</p>
<p>I take a holistic approach to understanding Earth&rsquo;s water cycle, producing and combining information from weather observations, climate model simulations, and natural archives of climate variability through past centuries (e.g., tree rings and ice cores). I study water cycle behaviour on spatial scales from local to global and on time scales from monthly to multi-centennial.</p>
<p>I am currently a DECRA fellow at The University of Adelaide (Australia). Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Australian National University (working with the <a href="https://climateextremes.org.au//" target="_blank">ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes</a>), and before that a postdoctoral researcher at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Aside from climate science, my interests are many and varied: edited highlights include running, swimming, cross country skiing, telemark skiing, spoon-carving, reading fantasy novels, taking bad photos with old film cameras, using the Oxford comma, and playing guitar &amp; violin.</p>

<p>I am pleased to have become a member of the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/environment/" target="_blank">Environment Institute</a> at The University of Adelaide. The Institute brings together researchers across ecology, biology, biodiversity, anthropology, climate science and more to tackle the environmental challenges facing Australia. I&rsquo;m looking forward to working within such a multi-disciplinary group.</p>
<p>I recently wrote a blog post for the Institute, describing my Australian drought research: <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/environment/news/list/2025/04/15/is-australia-ready-for-a-20-year-megadrought" target="_blank">you can read the blog post here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="26-march-2025">26 March 2025</h3>
<p>Today I started my <a href="https://dataportal.arc.gov.au/NCGP/Web/Grant/Grant/DE250100071" target="_blank">DECRA fellowship</a> at The University of Adelaide.</p>
<p>Over the next three years I will be combining information from</p>
<ul>
<li>weather observations (including rainwater isotopes),</li>
<li>tree rings, and</li>
<li>climate model simulations</li>
</ul>
<p>for a holistic understanding of Australian droughts and how they are changing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got a lot of other fun stuff going on too - splashing around in the giant mysterious tropical Pacific, trying to figure out what the deal is with volcanic eruptions and climate, continuing my evolution into Australia&rsquo;s Megadrought Girl etc.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a lot happening in the <a href="https://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/2k-network/intro" target="_blank">PAGES 2k Network</a> as we start building a new database of Common Era hydroclimate proxy records.</p>
<p>Suffice to say that with some new students, teaching into some new courses, and of course my role as a <a href="https://scienceandtechnologyaustralia.org.au/what-we-do/superstars-of-stem/" target="_blank">Superstar of STEM</a>, it&rsquo;s not going to be a relaxed few years. Please get in touch if you&rsquo;d like more info on any of my research OR especially if you&rsquo;d like to collaborate!</p>
<h3 id="19-december-2024">19 December 2024</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m honoured to have been selected by Science and Technology Australia to participate in the 2025/2026 <a href="https://scienceandtechnologyaustralia.org.au/what-we-do/superstars-of-stem/" target="_blank">Superstars of STEM</a> programme.</p>
<p>The programme aims to break down gender assumptions about who can work in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and boost media visibility of women and non-binary STEM experts. After a long selection process, myself and 59 other STEM professionals from across Australia - across fields, industries, and career stages - will be supported in appearing as expert commentators on Australian media, on platforms from news and panel shows to social media and public events. The idea is to show the community that a scientist can look like&hellip;.well, anything. And also to encourage a more diverse range of young people to follow their STEM dreams. This is more important than ever, with Australia facing, horrifyingly, a <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-boys-outperforming-girls-in-maths-245357" target="_blank">widening junior- and high-school gender gap in science and mathematics</a>. This gap is, of course, not due to any inherent gender-based difference in STEM abilities, but rather the wildly inaccurate stereotype of STEM being more for boys than girls.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to do my bit to push change - and fly the flag for the critical importance of climate science while I&rsquo;m at it.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be one of three invited speakers the final <a href="https://www.tern.org.au/" target="_blank">TERN (Terrestrial Infrastructure Research Network)</a> webinar for the year. TERN maintains an amazing climate and environmental observational network across Australia, facilitating a wide range of research.</p>
<p>TERN runs a very popular public webinar series, with a different topic each time. For the webinar I was invited to speak in, the topic was <i>Drought: challenges of monitoring and measuring</i>. I talked about climate model evidence for Australian megadroughts: if you&rsquo;re interested, you can catch the recording here:

<p>Just out in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094724000951" target="_blank"><em>Weather and Climate Extremes</em></a>: we show that the severity of Australia&rsquo;s 2017-2019 &lsquo;Tinderbox&rsquo; drought (the one that preceded the 2019/20 bushfires) was likely made worse by climate change.</p>
<p>We use Linear Inverse Models to produce 10,000 years of &lsquo;pseudo-observations&rsquo; of Australian rainfall and global SST anomalies, and use these to quantify the <strong>full</strong> natural range of natural variability in Australian rainfall. Turns out, rainfall deficits over the Murray-Darling Basin during the Tinderbox Drought fall outside that range. This was largely driven by the very severe deficits in 2019, which co-occurred with a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole event.</p>
<p>We also looked into the relationship of Murray-Darling Basin rainfall and global SST anomalies more broadly. We show that the most reliable predictors of very dry years in the Murray-Darling Basin are positive SSTs in the central tropical Pacific and western Indian Oceans. Both maps in the figure below show characteristic anomalies during the driest 5th percentile of years in the Murray-Darling Basin.</p>

    <span class="image ">
        <img src="img/LIM_drymaps.PNG" alt="" />
    </span>



<p>To look at that another way, the driest years in the Murray-Darling Basin are most reliably (although not always) associated with positive anomalies in the Nino 3.4 and Dipole Mode indices. In the plot below, the grey cloud shows the full distribution of co-occurring Nino 3.4 and DMI anomalies in our 10,000 LIM years. The blue cloud shows the subset of those years where MDB rainfall was in the lowest 5th percentile.</p>

<p>A very exciting announcement - I was lucky enough to be awarded an Australian Research Council DECRA fellowship. This major grant will support my research over the next three years, using multiple information sources to quantify Australia&rsquo;s long-term rainfall risk.</p>
<p>This fellowship will allow me the freedom to keep pushing the boundaries of my particular flavour of (palaeo)climate science - blending information from climate models, weather observations, and palaeoclimate proxy data to allow a holistic understanding of the water cycle and how it&rsquo;s changing with human-caused climate change.</p>
<p>After a few years spent mainly developing new numerical methods for understanding climate change, I&rsquo;m excited to get back in the lab and produce some new water isotope data, as well as trying my hand at isotope dendrochronology 🌲 💍 To complete the trifecta, I&rsquo;ll also (shockingly, to those who know me) produce new model simulations investigating the effect of Indo-Pacific SST variability on Australian hydroclimate.</p>
<p>My DECRA success was, of course, due in large part to the many people who generously provided advice and/or feedback on my application - many thanks to all of you.</p>
<p>More information about the 2025 DECRA round is available <a href="https://rms.arc.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/1b0c8b2e-7bb0-4f2d-8f52-ad207cfbb41d/265" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a> and <a href="https://www.arc.gov.au/funding-research/funding-outcome/selection-outcome-reports/selection-report-discovery-early-career-researcher-award-funding-commencing-2025" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a>, with the funded projects list available <a href="https://rms.arc.gov.au/RMS/Report/Download/Report/1b0c8b2e-7bb0-4f2d-8f52-ad207cfbb41d/2655" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a>.</p>

<i>Here I am planning science how I plan it best - at a whiteboard. This particular whiteboard is in the lecture room at James Cook University&rsquo;s Orpheus Island Research Station - where every year I&rsquo;m lucky enough to co-teach a coral reef field studies course. I used this whiteboard in 2023 to sketch out the plans for my proposal, and then again one year later to start planning my first pocket of DECRA science.</i>.</p>

<p>Out today in <a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/28/1383/2024/" target="_blank"><em>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</em></a> is our assessment of multi-year droughts in climate model simulations of the last millennium.</p>
<p>We looked at Australian drought characteristics in  11 climate models, including how simulated droughts in pre-Industrial times compared with 20th century droughts. We found that on average, droughts in SE and SW Australia are getting longer.</p>

    <span class="image ">
        <img src="img/Map%20showing%20longer%20droughts%20in%20SW%20and%20E%20Aus.png" alt="" />
    </span>



<p>But also, natural variability in Australian rainfall could bring 20+ year droughts - including to the food bowl of Australia (the Murray-Darling Basin).</p>

<p>We also show that the  short observational era isn&rsquo;t long enough to get the full picture around the statistics of multi-year droughts - highlighting the need for more targeted palaeoclimate data.</p>
